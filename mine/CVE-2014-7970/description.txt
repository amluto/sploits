Linux's pivot_root(2) is written under the assumption that fs->root
is an ancestor of both the old and new directories.  If this assumption
is violated, then pivot_root can malfunction and leak memory.

I haven't yet found a way to cause other forms of corruption, but
I don't want to rule it out, either.
